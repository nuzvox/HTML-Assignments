			<blockquote><span><a href="" title="Reviews"> <img src="PIC\\review.png" alt="U.A.C Professionals Office Building" width="100px " height="100px " style="float: left; margin: 10px"/></a>Everything from U.A.C Professionals has been a great experience. Some problems with delivery, but UPS is at fault with that. Stated it would be here no later than 1415 hrs. So I stayed home to accept and sign for it. Didn't show up until 1945 hrs. and I was not asked to sign for it. The delivery person walked away without it. So a day wasted due to UPS. Some problems with Windows but a call to them got that fixed up in no time. Microsoft 365 locked me out of a lot of areas stating my IT administrator locked that so I could not use it. Fixed now. But all of that is of no fault of U.A.C. Everything with the ordering, shipping, setup, and running has been great. Would I buy another one? I am thinking of replacing my laptop and U.A.C is on the top of the list for doing that. <br><cite> — Kevin Q (Ben)</cite><br></span></blockquote>
			
			<blockquote><span><img src="PIC\\review.png" alt="U.A.C Professionals Office Building" width="100px " height="100px " style="float: left; margin: 10px"/></a>Everything was easy and handled well. Bobby took care of any questions I had whenever I needed to ask anything and helped me through the process, the product was even sent early! Packaging was fantastic and I felt comfortable and confident in the safety of the computer. The laser engraving is a little bit off in places here and there, but it's not too bad. I do wish there had been more updates or WIPS throughout the process as I eventually just stopped getting emails or progress updates in general after a certain point without me having to log on and check the status. Overall, I'm satisfied and love my new PC.<br><cite> — Jim (Zander)</cite><br></span></blockquote>
			<blockquote><span><img src="PIC\\review.png" alt="U.A.C Professionals Office Building" width="100px " height="100px " style="float: left; margin: 10px"/></a>Everything went well. System shipped on the expected date (a Friday) and UPS actually delivered a day before the 3 business days were up (on Tuesday instead of Wednesday). Packing was excellent and everything arrived in excellent condition. Willis Leung was my rep and did a good job of communicating progress in building the system. One part was "almost" late, but must have arrived the day before the system needed to ship (he notified me that there might be a problem and asked if I wanted to substitute for that part). I told him a substitute was OK, but the original brand item was in the system, so it arrived in time for the build. The build was well done. Fairly neat wire routing, everything hooked up and working. My only (very minor) issue was noise from the system case fans. This was caused by using the included case fan distribution setup, which seems like a solution in search of a problem. Using the fan distro board forces all the fans (CPU and case) to run at the same speed as each other. And it seems like all of them were running pretty fast and not changing based on need. So I moved all the fans back to plug into the motherboard where I could set their speed in the bios, based on temperature. Now my system is whisper quiet. Inside of case is at 35C, CPU running at ~ 55C. If I'd known there was a fans distro board in the case, I would have ask Willis to leave it out of the loop......but I can't fault U.A.C for using it.<br><cite> — Miranda (Wilqua)</cite><br></span></blockquote>
