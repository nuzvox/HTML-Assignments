			<h1>Welcome to the PC Builder</h1>
			<h4>Here you will be guided through the creation of your computer; starting off, we will explain the importance of each component that you will be selecting.</h4>
			<section id = "S1">
				<p><strong>The Case or Computer Tower </strong><br> There are several reasons why we use computer cases. One is for protection, which is easy to assume because it's the most obvious. Dust, animals, toys, liquids, etc. can all damage the internal parts of a computer if the hard shell of a computer case doesn't enclose them and keep them away from the outside environment.<br><br> Another good reason to use a computer case is to keep the area cool. Proper airflow over the computer components is one more benefit to using a computer case. While the case has special vents to allow some of the fan air to escape, the rest of it can be used to cool down the hardware, which would otherwise get pretty hot and possibly overheat to the point of malfunction.<p>

				<p><strong>The Motherboard </strong><br> Selecting a motherboard is a critical decision. It houses the most important parts of your PC, such as the graphics card, CPU, and every other component your computer needs to be functional. <br><br>If your motherboard dies, your PC is out of commission until it’s fixed or replaced. Before purchasing, take into account the need for a motherboard that supports all the hardware you plan on incorporating into your build: PCIe slots for video cards, SATA ports for drives, adequate memory slots for your desired amount of memory, USB ports for peripherals, etc. The good news is that you won’t need to break the bank when choosing a motherboard. There are good options at every price level — it all just depends on what you’ve got in mind for your build.<p>

				<p><strong>The CPU or Centeral Processing Unit </strong><br> A processor provides the instructions that multiple applications and processes need to perform their jobs. The faster it does that, the faster a computer operates. Faster computers often translate into increased productivity and efficiency. Computers onboard Apollo 11 in 1969 were less powerful than a cell phone. <br><br>Today, technological advances in chip manufacturing make it possible for computers with faster processors to run programs, play movies and blaze through complex calculations at remarkable speeds.<p>

			<section id = "S1">
				<p><strong>The Graphic Processing Unit or Graphics Card </strong><br> The GPU of your device is so important mainly because it makes games run more efficiently and makes them look better with higher resolution graphics and improved framerates, or how many frames per second the game runs at.<br><br> Higher framerates mean smoother, faster games with less stutter or freezing due to load on the CPU. The GPUs of modern smartphones are capable of rendering 3D games and a lot of effects easily and this allows developers to make better looking and more complex games as a result. The GPU also aids the CPU in its workload and makes your device more power efficient and faster altogether.<p>

			<section id = "S2">
				<p><strong>Solid State Drives, Hard Disk Drives and Hybrids </strong><br> The hard disk drive is probably the most important component to your computer. Without it your computer would never be able to save any files, you would not be able to boot up your operating system, and could never play a game or download a file. <br><br> An SSD is a storage device with no moving mechanical parts that houses flash memory and controllers. SSDs use the same external form factors as HDDs, because they are marketed as hard drive replacements. Using the same form factors does not require massive re-engineering of storage arrays at the factory or data center levels. <br><br> A hybrid hard drive contains both a traditional magnetic drive and the amount of solid-state storage you’d find in a small solid-state drive.  <p>

				<p><strong>The Power Supply or PSU </strong><br> Your computer’s power supply, or PSU, is a critical part of your computer. It has to supply the exact or near exact voltage at the required wattage to all of the circuitry inside your computer. The processor and memory are particularly sensitive and require an exact supply or as near as possible to one.<p>
			</section>
			<section id = "S1">
				<p><strong>The Memory or RAM </strong><br> RAM is essentially the core of your computer. It can be considered just as important as your processor, or hard drive. With the right amount of RAM on your computer the performance of your PC and the ability to support various types of software is optimized. <br><br> The overall performance of your computer is determined by how well your CPU and RAM work together. The more RAM your CPU has access to, the easier its job becomes, which enables a faster computer. If you do not have a sufficient amount of RAM than your CPU has to work much, much harder to transfer data, which severally damages the computer’s performance.<p>
